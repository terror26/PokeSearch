# PokeSearch
An App to locate the Pokemon and pin the location of the pokemon if you find it in your area.

Geofire is used to update and save the location of the pokemon you discovered.
Cool annotation makes the app look more amazing plus you can choose the annotation of the pokemon you spotted from the pokemon list.
For a fan of Pokemon its a must have app as it lets you see the location of the pokemon on map!

MapKit is implemented to its max plus you can get the direction of the Pokemon by just clicking on the Pokemon you wanna search
and then clicking it again to get its route.

Your location is shown using a cool Ash Ketchup annotation image!
